# SmartFuse
SmartFuse â€“ Intelligent Charging Automation SmartFuse is an Arduino-based system that dynamically controls charging based on battery levels. Using PyFirmata, psutil, and relay modules, it prevents overcharging, conserves energy, and enhances battery life. Ideal for smart power management in IoT and automation projects. âš¡

## Prerequisites for SmartFuse

###### ðŸ”§ HARDWARE

- Arduino Nano (or compatible microcontroller)

- Relay Module (for charging control)

- Connecting Wires (for secure connections)

###### ðŸ’» SOFTWARE

- Python (for automation logic) (3.10V IS RECOMMENDE)

- PyFirmata (to communicate with Arduino)

- Psutil (to read battery percentage)

- Arduino IDE (for initial setup and testing)
